# Native engine (`fifa96_engine`)

The native engine layer sits on top of the 56 clean-room `fifa96_*` libraries and
turns them into a running game: platform ABI → SDL3/null backends → engine core
(boot, asset table, clock, intro, front-end, match).

Status: **M1 complete headless; M2 match playable, visible and RGB-visible —
14/80 action rows wired, the derived FU-143 phase driver wired into the run
loop (live period end 2 → 0x0C), the derived C3-OL2 score source, live OL-80
animation inputs, the derived kickoff ball placement, the resource-loaded
formation/record placement (OL-T11-8: `352ko.fmt` seated from
`/ART/GAMEART0.PVI` at begin, so player records receive real positions and
draw), the derived kickoff phase-1 entry (OL-84: begin lands
`FIFA96_MATCH_RUN_KICKOFF_PHASE = 1`), the derived `FUN_0008D098` state-1
kickoff arm + wired action row 01 (M2 playable-match Task 2: a begun run
reaches the live phase 2 naturally via situation 0xB), the derived native
match palette
(OL-T11-6: `PALsys.fsh` frame 2 installed onto the presented surface, so the
indexed draw is RGB under SDL3 — FU-144), the derived match HUD (OL-T11-7:
the Frames.fsh bar + the FNTI-font name/score/period/clock overlay staged by
BIGF name from GAMEART0 and drawn on the indexed canvas — FU-148; M2
full-gameplay P0.2, golden re-pinned for the HUD) and **pad-driven locomotion
for the
controlled record (M2 interactive Task 1 / G1: the derived FU-70 setup slot
bind + `FUN_0007876C` merge attach the human slot to the kickoff taker, row
00's slot-direction target feeds the wired FU-77 shared mover
`FUN_0007BF20` for that record, and the M2 golden is re-pinned for the
resulting movement — first differing line frame 59, 107 hash lines).** The M2-B acceptance tape **v5**
(M2 playable-match Task 4, the G4 acceptance) is
green: it asserts the drawing directly (the formation-placed records reach the
indexed canvas from the first granted frame; the golden was re-pinned for that
upgrade, T1), the kickoff entry at begin (T2; transcript byte-identical), the
RGB palette at the first match present **and on the drawn canvas** (T1/T4 of
follow-up 4; the golden was re-pinned for the palette — first differing line
frame 6, 160 of 165 lines, state suffixes unchanged), the HUD overlay (P0.2:
golden v5 re-pinned — first differing line frame 6, 160 of 165 lines, state
suffixes unchanged; the frame-6 assertion pins the Frames.fsh bar and the
font staging), the natural phase-1 → 2
chain (T2: the golden stays byte-identical with the kept 0x13/0x14/2 forcing,
whose mismatch evidence is in FU-143 §11.5) and the natural-phase-2 probe (T4:
`run_natural_probe` replays the tape with no directives and lands live phase 2
at step 409 with row 01 dispatched and score 0-0). The interactive `make game`
smoke re-run
on this host (2026-10-08, follow-up-4 G4) reaches match start with the same
byte-identical non-black
RGB canvas as the G1 shot (player sprites in the derived palette's magenta/olive).
Kick →
score and the live goal invokers remain blocked interactively on the
unported possession/selection rows and goal invoker machinery
(see "Interactive smoke" and "Known gaps"). The M2 visible-match plan's G1/G2
closed **carried-with-legs** (indexed draw and phase-1 entry landed; RGB
palette `OL-T11-6` was carried and is now landed by follow-up 4, and the OL-84
residual is landed by T2) and G3 is
accepted here; the earlier playability-legs plan's G1/G2 closed, G3 carried
and G4 accepted. See

## Building and testing

`make check` configures, builds `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and runs all 104 CTest
cases — including the `test_engine_*` cases built under ASan/UBSan. No external
dependency is required for this: the `null` backend is the deterministic
regression source of truth (it hashes Mode-X planes + palette and PCM, replays
input tapes, and advances a virtual 10 ms clock). With SDL3 ≥ 3.x installed,
the build also produces the windowed `fifa96` target (`make game`).

## What runs today

- Boot from the real CD image (`game/FIFAPCCD96.iso`): ISO mount, asset table,
  loader-spine resource scan.
- Intro playback of `VIDEO/*.TGV` (M1 heuristic: prefers `/VIDEO/VID_INTR.TGV`;
  the true boot-intro choice awaits the underived load-order table). Input skips
  the intro.
- Front-end state machine with key mapping, menu rendering (procedural fallback —
  the retail front-end art asset is unresolved; FU135 erratum) and quit.
- Front-end → match bridge for the panel-confirm start classification (selector
  0), with the derived `/ART/PLAYART.PVI` + `/ART/GAMEART0.PVI` staging pair
  (soft failure without the ISO).
- Match: FU-64 lifecycle, FU-60 30 Hz pace, FU-61 input → FU-70 control slot
  per granted frame, FU-71 camera / FU-90 display / FU-141 entity/ball chain
  (including the OL-80 live `anim_id`/`frame` staging into the FU-84 bank
  chain, the derived kickoff ball placement and the OL-T11-8
  formation/record placement at begin: `352ko.fmt` from `/ART/GAMEART0.PVI`
  seeds both teams' targets before the `FUN_00079B6C` commit), FU-142a
  installer arms in phases 0x13/0x14, the FU-143 phase driver
  (`fifa96_match_run_phase_drive`: the derived class gate + `FUN_0008B9CC`
  period-end chooser, so a live class-1 period end writes phase 0x0C on the
  selector-0 default), deterministic FU-85/88/89 render chain, the derived
  native match palette (OL-T11-6: `fifa96_match_palette_from_bank` +
  `fifa96_match_run_palette_install` install `PALsys.fsh` frame 2's
  kit-remapped/appended chunk as the surface palette before the plane
  conversion — FU-144), period end
  (`resolve` OVER→POST→EXIT) back to the front-end.
  **Pad-driven locomotion (M2 interactive Task 1 / G1):** begin runs the
  derived match-setup slot bind (`fifa96_match_entities_bind_slot`, the
  `FUN_00078824`→`FUN_000785E0`/`FUN_0008DB6C` subset) and consumes the
  state-1 arm's `FUN_0007876C` merge, so the FU-70 slot is attached to the
  kickoff taker; the per-frame dispatch stages the slot's T2/T3 direction
  bytes (`+0x20/+0x21`) into the record and runs the FU-77 shared mover
  `fifa96_action_locomotion_step` (`FUN_0007BF20` blocks A–E, tables
  `0x1104D2`/`0x10F680` pinned first-hand) for the slot-bound record, so a
  held pad direction drives row 00's `FUN_00079C20` target into
  velocity/position. Row 01 stage 1 now takes the native
  `word[slot+6] & 0x70` release gate, so the natural kickoff waits for a
  button press/release exactly as the native.
- Action dispatch (FU-137): **14/80 rows wired** — `00`, `01`, `04`, `06`,
  `07`, `08`, `0F`, `18`, `1E`, `21`, `23` (playability G1 + arms-and-wiring
  G3; `01` is the M2 playable-match Task 2 kickoff taker) and
  `26`, `28`, `2A` (cluster G); dispatch results 65 UNSUP / 14 OK / 1 NOTF.
- **Interactive smoke (playable-match follow-up 4 G4 re-run, this host
  2026-10-08; first verified Task 13):** `make game` window opens (960×720
  integer-scaled SDL3; ESC quits, exit 0; the intro and the procedural
  front-end draw — screenshots). The walkthrough reaches **match start** —
  intro RETURN skip → front-end BACKSPACE (DECLINE/panel) → RETURN (panel
  confirm → FU-66 STATE16 bridge) — and the match canvas replaces the
  front-end **with RGB visible**: the OL-T11-6 palette install (FU-144) shows
  the drawn player sprites in the derived palette's magenta (0x38/0x11/0x28
  range) with olive accents on the index-0 black background. The G4 re-run
  shot (`docs/screens/task-4-rgb-match.png`) is **byte-identical** to the G1
  shot (`sha256 51585387…`): **0.47% non-black**, whole-window mean 0.002, the
  dominant sprite color exactly `#E044A0` (6-bit 0x38/0x11/0x28 `<< 2`) with
  olive/brown accents — colored, not grayscale, and reproducible. The
  OL-T11-8 formation draw is live in the indexed canvas and pinned by the tape
  (the HUD landed afterwards in M2 full-gameplay P0.2 / OL-T11-7; this G4
  screenshot predates it, so the HUD band is empty in it). The screenshots establish the Return
  advance: the panel-open BackSpace frame is byte-identical to the preceding
  one (`docs/screens/task-4-frontend.png`), and the match-canvas change is the
  panel-confirm shot. A held RIGHT/UP liveness probe left the canvas
  byte-identical: the presses reach the run's input model (the tape v3
  assertion at step 7/9, corroborated by the earlier Task 13 in-process probe:
  `input_state[0]` = 0x04 RIGHT / 0x01 UP / 0x10 KICK / 0x20 PASS) but no wired
  row consumes them, so the records do not move on screen. The T5 kickoff
  placement was probed live there too: ball at (480, 0, 0) = the derived 0x1E0
  spawn, record 0's OL-80 `anim_id` at 0x26, score 0-0; a begun run enters the
  derived kickoff phase 1 (OL-84, below) and reaches phase 2 headlessly (T4
  natural probe).
  **Kick and score are still not interactively reachable:** the kick press
  dispatches no gameplay row (the possession/selection invokers are unported)
  and gameplay goals have no wired invoker (OL-87/OL-88/OL-89; the derived
  score writer has no gameplay caller). The phase-1 → phase-2 transition is
  derived (follow-up-4 T2 lands the `FUN_0008D098` state-1 arm and action
  row 01; the frame-body fixture and the T4 tape-level natural probe pin the
  natural phase 2 — FU-143 §11), but it is not visible in a screenshot: the
  HUD has no phase readout (it shows the period/clock/score, not the phase;
  the HUD itself landed in P0.2 / OL-T11-7), so the
  on-screen claim rests on the headless evidence. The M2-B tape v4 covers the
  sequence headlessly with its
  declared/forced phases and the live driver's period end.

  Reached vs blocked (G4 smoke, 2026-10-08):

  | step | state | evidence |
  |---|---|---|
  | window + intro + front-end draw | reached | intro/front-end screenshots; ESC exit 0 |
  | panel DECLINE/CONFIRM → match start | reached | match canvas replaces the front-end; `task-4-rgb-match.png` |
  | RGB palette on the match canvas | reached | `#E044A0` sprite pixels; tape frame-6 palette assertion |
  | OL-T11-8 formation draw | reached | 0.47% non-black canvas; tape frames 8/9 pixel counts |
  | kickoff → phase 2 naturally | reached (headless) | tape v4 `run_natural_probe`: live phase 2 at step 409, row 01 dispatched; no phase readout on screen (the HUD landed in P0.2 and shows score/clock, not the phase) |
  | move the controlled player | blocked on screen | held RIGHT/UP leaves the canvas byte-identical; presses reach `input_state[0]` but no wired row consumes them (possession/locomotion invokers unported) |
  | kick (KICK press) | blocked | no gameplay row dispatched (tape steps 12/15); possession/selection invokers unported |
  | score a goal | blocked | no goal invoker reachable (OL-87/88/89 verified negative); the tape's score step is the direct derived writer |
  | half/period end → exit | reached | headless (tape: live class-1 period end → phase 0x0C → OVER→POST→EXIT); native periods last minutes, so not run to completion in the smoke |
  | HUD score/clock | absent in this G4 shot | landed after this smoke (M2 full-gameplay P0.2 / OL-T11-7, FU-148): bar + names/score/clock staged and drawn on the indexed canvas, tape v5 re-pinned; the shot predates it |
- `test_engine_m1` pins the 691-frame M1 transcript
  (`tests/golden/engine/m1-frames.txt`).
- `test_engine_m2` replays spec §5 (boot → skip intro → front-end → start match
  → kickoff → move → kick → score → period end → exit to front-end) and pins
  the 165-frame M2-B transcript (`tests/golden/engine/m2-frames.txt`):
  `frame=<n> hash=<hex>` plus `state=<phase>/<home>-<away>` while a match is
  live, the forced kickoff phases 0x13/0x14, the wired-row `FIFA96_OK` dispatch
  set, and the score step. Tape **v4** (M2 playable-match Task 4; the v3
  provenance is retained) stages the
  wired rows (including the G1 rows 04/08), asserts the natural path:
  the KICK press reaches the run but dispatches no gameplay row, the kickoff
  placement is pinned at match start (ball 0x1E0/0/0, `anim_id` 0x26), the
  **formation seed** loaded `352ko.fmt` so records carry real positions
  (record 0: team 0 z = -2376, team 1 z = +2508), and the live FU-143 driver's
  derived 0x0C write is read back after the exit step (where the teardown has
  reset the match state but not the FU-142a mirror). The Task 3 acceptance
  asserts the **drawing directly**: the pre-grant match frames render the empty
  list (0 non-background pixels) and the first granted frame (step 9) stages
  all 23 render slots and puts the placed records on the indexed canvas
  (pixels > 0; team 1 record 0 staged at z = +2508 with the kickoff selector
  row 0x26) — the golden hash chain is corroborated, not trusted alone. Task 2
  adds the **derived
  kickoff phase entry (OL-84)**: `fifa96_match_run_begin` installs
  `FIFA96_MATCH_RUN_KICKOFF_PHASE = 1` (the native `FUN_00088DC8` stage-0
  `FUN_000740A0(1, side)` write at `0x88E82`), so a begun run starts at the
  kickoff-placement phase (class 0) and the tape's m 1 directive forces the
  live phase over it. Follow-up-4 T2 lands the **residual**: begin also runs
  the derived `FUN_0008D098` state-1 arm
  (`fifa96_match_phase_machine_kickoff`), the wired action row 01 turns the
  derived act-1 producer (`global_5882a` at `tick_total >= 0x78`) into the
  situation-0xB -> `0x8AEF6` -> `0x8AF02` phase-2 write, and
  `test_engine_match_frame::test_kickoff_enters_phase2_naturally` pins a begun
  run reaching the live phase 2 with no forcing (FU-143 §11). The 0x13/0x14
  forced window **stays** because the natural chain is not frame-for-frame
  identical to it (the forced window drives the FU-142a 26/28/2A arm staging
  and its `state=19/20` lines; measured mismatch: hashes identical through
  golden line 48, first divergence at line 49, natural phase 2 at presented
  frame 410 = granted frame ~121 — FU-143 §11.5). The T2 tape transcript is
  **byte-identical** after the wiring (no re-pin; the wired-row observation set
  grows to 14 rows: row 01 joins and row 00 still dispatches through a wired
  row's reset install). The **T1** transcript changed
  and the golden was re-pinned for the drawing upgrade: the first differing
  line is frame 9 (the first granted render staging), 157 lines differ (the
  null backend chains its present hash across all presented frames, so the
  post-exit front-end lines carry the earlier change while their canvases are
  repainted identically). The **follow-up-4 T1** transcript changed again and
  the golden was re-pinned for the **palette upgrade** (`OL-T11-6`):
  `fifa96_match_run_render` installs the staged palette from the first match
  present on, so the first differing line is frame 6 (match start is frame 5;
  frame 6 is the first MATCH-branch present), all 160 lines 6..165 differ, and
  every `state=` suffix is unchanged. The **full-gameplay P0.2** transcript
  changed again and the golden was re-pinned for the **HUD upgrade**
  (`OL-T11-7`, FU-148 §10): the bridge stages the HUD entries from GAMEART0
  (clockfnt.fsh/playfnt.fsh/frames Frames.fsh) and the render draws the
  derived bar + score/clock overlay from the first match frame, so the first
  differing line is frame 6 (golden `eece28cb8ebe5731`, actual
  `9c940e7b1ac18675`) and 160 lines 6..165 differ (6..145 carry the canvas
  change, 146..165 the chained present hash); every `state=` suffix is again
  unchanged. The tape's scene-pixel evidence is counted above the derived HUD
  band (`bar_y = 240 - 41 - 2 = 197`; count `y < 190`), so frames 6..8 still
  assert zero SCENE pixels, and frame 6 asserts the staged bar's first-hand
  frame-13 pixel (0,0) = 0x45 at (2,197). The tape asserts the RGB directly: at
  frame 6 `render.palette_ready == 1`, the surface palette's staged **chunk
  entry 1** is 6-bit (0x38,0x11,0x28) -> (0xE0,0x44,0xA0), and > 700 of the 768
  palette bytes are nonzero; `render.palette` equals the pure extraction over
  the staged `PALsys.fsh` bank (`test_engine_match_staging`). **v4** adds the
  canvas-level RGB assertion (some non-background frame-9 canvas pixel maps
  through the installed surface palette to a non-black triplet), the
  `run_natural_probe` (the same tape with no directives reaches the live phase
  2 at step 409 with row 01 dispatched and the score/writer cells fresh) and
  re-states the T3 negative score and the 14-row dispatch shape (row 01 joins;
  row 00 dispatches through a wired row's reset). The transcript is
  byte-identical in v4 (no re-pin), so T2/T3/T4 moved no presented frame. M1
  stays
  byte-identical. Regenerate with
  `./build/test_engine_m2 > tests/golden/engine/m2-frames.txt` (the test exits
  non-zero while rewriting the file; re-run `make check` to verify).

## Known gaps

- **Visible-match leg register (M2 visible-match plan close-out, 2026-10-08;
  follow-up-4 update 2026-10-08).**
  Landed: `OL-T11-8` (formation/record placement — indexed draw live, golden
  re-pinned), `OL-84`'s phase-1 entry (begin installs
  `FIFA96_MATCH_RUN_KICKOFF_PHASE = 1`; transcript byte-identical), the
  `OL-84` residual kickoff chain (follow-up-4 T2: the `FUN_0008D098` state-1
  arm + action row 01 + the derived act-1 producer; the begun run reaches the
  live phase 2, transcript byte-identical with the forcing kept per FU-143
  §11.5) and
  `OL-T11-6` (the derived native match palette — FU-144; golden re-pinned for
  the RGB upgrade) and `OL-T11-7` (the match score/clock HUD — FU-148 §10;
  M2 full-gameplay P0.2, golden v5 re-pinned for the HUD upgrade; remaining
  HUD legs `OL-T11-71`…`OL-T11-75`: the nibble colour ramp, the team-name
  stage, extra-time strings/period offset, the settings/suppress gate writers
  and the bar blit's exact span scaler). Carried
  open: the remaining `OL-84` situation-0xB producers (rows 02/0x10..0x13) and
  row 01's event/camera/ball-stage sinks, plus the FU-73 keeper/restart
  producers
  `0x7546E`/`0x75B58`/`0x76072`; `OL-85` extra-time flag wiring; `OL-87`/
  `OL-88`/`OL-89` goal invokers (Task 3 verdict: no invoker reachable from the
  ported state — FU-142 App. L.9); `OL-81`/`OL-83` row-field wrinkles; `OL-82`
  row-08 scan producer; the T1 formation-id producer
  (`[0x14C1E4]`/`[0x14C1E5]`, engine derives id 0) and the camera-mode/angle
  feed the live per-record framing would use (FU-96 legs 1/3; the place itself
  landed in T2); `OL-62`..`OL-71` residuals. The items
  have their detailed entries below / in the FU docs. Follow-up-4 G4 (M2
  playable-match Task 4) closes the plan's whole-range review: G1
  (RGB pitch) and G2 (natural kickoff → phase 2) **carried-with-legs**, G3
  (goal invokers) **carried-with-legs — verified negative**, G4 accepted
  (tape v4 + natural probe + the G4 smoke); every forcing in the tape is
  listed with its leg in the `test_engine_m2.c` v4 provenance.
- **M2 interactive T1 (pad-driven locomotion / G1) legs.** The derived setup
  bind models the engine's single human slot: the native four `0x4C1E0` mode
  rows are unported (derived default mode 0 = the controlled side), the
  `FUN_0008DB6C` sort/tie order of the free-record pick is substituted by the
  shared `fifa96_entity_find_nearest` (`FUN_000A1860` order is the leg; the
  no-candidate fallback `0x8DC1B` is bind leg 7), and
  the FU-77 mover `FUN_0007BF20` is wired for the slot-bound (controlled)
  record only — the native calls it for every record after its handler, so the
  AI-side integration is a numbered leg. Row 04's slot-dir arm for the
  controlled actor needs the unported `+0x6B` lane-word producer and the
  `+0x8D` active seed, so the natural phase-2 pad path stays a leg; the
  reachable pad consumer is row 00's slot-dir arm (wired) plus row 01's stage-1
  `word[slot+6] & 0x70` release gate (now wired to the live FU-70 release
  word) and the stage-2 conditional `FUN_0007876C` merge (live now that the
  bind increments `+0x828`; consumed by the frame drain). The mover's `+0x6F`
  stride rate, `+0x43` direct-face and `0x57A73` point inputs are staged zero.
  The word views `speed71`/`vel73`/`vel75` and the dword aliases
  `vel_x`/`vel_z` are kept in lockstep: the mover recomposes the dwords from
  the words, the dispatch decomposes arm-dword writes back onto the words, and
  the `FUN_00079B6C` commit zeroes the three words (T1 review fix; M2 golden
  unmoved by it).
- **M2 interactive T2 (per-record camera place `FUN_00079F3C` / G2).** The
  derived place runs at begin after the formation seed and before the
  `FUN_00079B6C` commit
  (`fifa96_match_entities_camera_place(pool, controlled_side, phase, cam_x,
  cam_z)`): per record of the non-controlled team (`byte[team+0x826] !=
  [0x157AAC]>>24`) with the live phase gate `byte[0x1106C3 + phase] != 0`, the
  `FUN_0008DCD4` octagonal camera distance is compared to `0x180` and a record
  at or inside the ring has its target snapped onto the `0x180` ring along its
  existing direction through the native `FUN_000CD474` angle, the `0x114E04`
  sine fold and the `FUN_000795A4` `(a*b + 0x8000) >> 16` multiply. The
  primitive ports are shared with FU-141 (`fifa96_arm_dist_stage`,
  `fifa96_entity_angle`, `fifa96_entity_sine`). The M2 golden is re-pinned
  (v4.2): the non-controlled side's in-ring records 9/10 move
  `(228,264) -> (251,291)` / `(-228,264) -> (-251,291)` before the commit,
  lines 1..48 stay byte-identical (those records project off-canvas at both
  radii — the place preserves the screen direction), the mechanics entry at
  frame 49 is the first differing line and 117 hash lines differ with no
  `state=` suffix moved. The place preserves the target's camera direction, so
  it cannot move the controlled side out from behind the camera; the one-sided
  kickoff draw is the **engine's stand-in view** (yaw/pitch 0), and native
  kickoff framing is carried on FU-96 legs 1/3 (the camera-mode/angle feed
  `[0x14E57C]`/`FUN_000505D0` presets `0x108B64` handlers `0x108B80`) plus the
  FU-71 follow writer `FUN_00071C94`, so T2 corrects the
  earlier "both sides draw at kickoff" expectation to "both teams placed where
  the native places them" — the visible place effect is fixtured where it is
  on-canvas (`test_camera_place_moves_near_record_into_frame`: an in-ring record
  below the `0x78` near gate moves onto the ring and draws). Without the
  formation resource the place is skipped so the documented zero-target
  degradation is preserved. Carried: the phase gate's `>= 0x1D` range (the
  native reads the adjacent action-pointer table), the camera-mode/angle feed
  (FU-96 legs 1/3) and the FU-71 follow writer that moves the camera during
  live play.
- **Unwired rows (66/80).** 65 rows dispatch `-FIFA96_ERR_UNSUPPORTED`: 27
  unported action rows, 34 phase rows (derived and ported at the loader level by
  FU-143 but not wired into the engine dispatch), the unwired actions
  `27`/`29`/`2C` (ported bodies, no installer entry) and the dead entry `2B`;
  phase `0x16` is the native zero/INT3 slot and the single
  `-FIFA96_ERR_NOT_FOUND`.
- **OL-48 rows 27/29/2C:** bodies ported and tested (FU-142b/c), but the
  FU-142f census finds no installer invocation for their codes anywhere in the
  image, so they stay unwired; row `2B` is a dead entry (shared row-29 RET).
- **OL-70/OL-70a rows 04/08:** the outfield decide/chase machine subset and the
  interception tail are ported; row `04`'s full body is ported and wired
  (FU-142 Appendix K.5 Task 1, `fifa96_outfield_row04_step` /
  `fifa96_match_action_04`; unmodeled inputs OL-72) and row `08`'s body
  `0x81068..0x814AF` is ported and wired (FU-142 Appendix K.6 Task 2,
  `fifa96_outfield_row08_step` / `fifa96_match_action_08`; no installer arm,
  unmodeled inputs/sinks OL-82). Both OL-70/OL-70a are closed.
- **OL-81 / OL-83 (playability-legs review legs).** OL-81: the FU-142a
  decision compares `[0x157AC5]`/`[0x157AC7]` byte-wide (the
  `fifa96_match_phase_machine` `ac5`/`ac7` fields are `uint8_t`) while the
  native words are 16-bit; no producer binds either word yet, so the
  divergence is unobservable until one lands (FU-142 §6). OL-83: rows
  04/06/07/18 read `record.actor_type` for the native `+0x8E` byte while rows
  08/28/2A write `record.type`, so a row-08 face write is invisible to the
  rows that natively share the byte — a latent wired-row divergence to
  reconcile in a follow-up (FU-142 §6/K.6.7).
- **OL-63 row 05:** the carrier machine stages 0-3 and the ball staging tail are
  ported; the stage-0 target algebra and the `FUN_0007F7E0` fallback remain.
- **OL-80 render anim inputs — closed (M2 playability Task 5; links FU-141
  OL-42):** `FUN_00036C70` stages each slot's `anim_id`
  (`byte[[rec+0x28]]`, 0x36D44) and `frame` (`byte[rec+0x3D]`, 0x36D4F). The
  FU-141 pool now carries both fields (`fifa96_match_entity.anim_id`/`.frame`,
  first-hand re-measured on `/FIFA96.EXE`: `0x36D44 MOV ECX,[EDX+0x28]; MOV
  CL,[ECX]`, `0x36D4F MOV CL,[EDX+0x3D]`), the scene staging seeds each slot
  from the live pool record and writes the FU-84 advance back into `frame`,
  the run dispatch stages `anim_id` into the arm record's `anim_sel` (rows
  28/2A write it back through `fifa96_arm_anim_select`) and rows 04/06/18
  stage `byte[[rec+0x28]]` from it, so the FU-84 row+8 bank selection and the
  row-08 `+0x3D` gate follow live values. The `0x6E598` RNG-reroll arm stays
  OL-52 and the installer animation arm that produces non-zero ids outside
  the wired bodies stays FU-141 OL-42.
- **Render legs `OL-T11-1`…`OL-T11-9` (Task 11 close-out register).** Task 11
  left the render chain's remaining legs under these IDs: FU-84 frame tables
  not staged (`-1`; advance uses identity durations, `sprite = frame`), row
  successor/terminal/height machine (`-2`), record facing `+0x7D` (`-3`),
  camera-type ratio setup `FUN_0004D7E8` (`-4`; static `0x1500` default),
  sentinel key scratch producer (`-5`), palette install/kit remap identity
  stand-in (`-6`; `FUN_00048DC0`/`FUN_000CE980`), HUD/overlays (`-7`), kickoff
  formation/record placement (`-8`),
  direction addend `0xA2A10` (`-9`); live anim inputs are `OL-80` above.
  `OL-T11-7` is now **landed (M2 full-gameplay P0.2; FU-148 §10)**: the match
  HUD chain (`FUN_000565BC` gates -> `FUN_00055C24`) is ported — the GAMEART0
  entries are staged by BIGF name (clockfnt.fsh slot 0x35 / playfnt.fsh 0x36,
  the FNTI decode in `fifa96_font`; the Frames.fsh bar frame 13 with frame 4's
  layout height, closing FU-148 §7 leg 2 via `FUN_00053930`'s `0x14E624`
  frame table), and `fifa96_match_run_render` draws the bar + name/score/
  period/clock overlay with the FU-148 §1.3/§1.4 layout (outline colour 6,
  main colour 0). The remaining HUD legs are `OL-T11-71`…`OL-T11-75` (FU-148
  §10 "Remaining numbered legs": colour ramp, name source, extra-time, gate
  writers, bar scaler); overlay draws outside the match HUD (marker/menu) stay
  unported.
  `OL-T11-6` is now **landed (M2 playable-match follow-up 4 T1; FU-144)**: the
  match-data load's palette chain (`FUN_00048ED8`/`FUN_00048B60` ->
  `FUN_00048C8C`/`FUN_000479A0`) is derived — `PALsys.fsh` (resource slot
  0x32, GAMEART0 entry 46) frame 2's type-0x22 chunk, the FU-98 kit remap in
  its native direction and the two chunk-range appends, `v << 2` to 8-bit —
  and installed on the presented surface (`fifa96_match_palette_from_bank`,
  `fifa96_match_run_palette_install`, staged by `fifa96_match_run_stage`), so
  the indexed draw is RGB in `make game`. Remaining `-6` legs: the
  per-entity translation tables `0x14BF60[slot]` (the native `0x14720` remap
  `FUN_00048DC0`/`FUN_000CE980` installs; the engine keeps the identity
  stand-in) and the untied `0x14B200` front-end base (FU-144 §6).
  `OL-T11-8` is now **landed (M2 visible-match Task 1)**:
  `FUN_00079B6C` (`0x79B6C..0x79C1C`) is ported in full commit + tail form —
  position := target, y = 0, target := position, both velocity pairs and the
  lane low word cleared, the camera-vs-target face, and the unconditional
  `0x79C13` `FUN_0006E598(rec, active ? 0 : 0x26, 0)` selector that gives
  inactive records row id 0x26 and resets the frame; the kickoff act-1 ball
  spawn (`[0x158830] = 0x1E0`, z = 0, ball.y = 0 via `FUN_0008C24C` `0x8C299`)
  is ported too (`fifa96_match_entities_place`/`_kickoff_place`, called at
  match begin after the camera reset). The per-record formation targets are
  now resource-landed: `fifa96_scene_formation_load`/`_place` evaluate
  `FUN_0006E1D0` over the 44-byte `.fmt` record (`[rec+8] =
  FUN_0004AFB8(6*id) + byte[rec+0x8D]*4`; {opp x/z, own x/z} pair;
  `x = (int8)b0*0x26`, `z = (int8)b1*0x21`, side-1 negated), the run loads
  `352ko.fmt` from the staged `/ART/GAMEART0.PVI` at begin
  (`fifa96_match_entities_seed_formation`) and the commit lands the non-zero
  positions, so player entities draw. The corrected name formats
  (`%s.fmt`/`%s.dat`/`%s.lfsh`/`%s.qfs` over the `0x107370` table) and the
  BIGF-entry location are recorded in the FU-89 §11 erratum; the remaining
  legs are the front-end formation-id producer (`[0x14C1E4]`/`[0x14C1E5]`,
  BSS 0; the engine derives id 0), the unused `.dat`/`.lfsh`/`.qfs` slots and
  the `[team+0x7DB]`/`[team+0x7DF]` pointers, and the roster `+0x90`/`+0x9A`
  bytes. The tail's conditional `FUN_0006E48C` `+0x3E` write stays a leg (no
  pool field). `[0x157AB1] = 0` is a process global with no derived home.
  Note the plan's "kickoff placement (OL-T11-9)" label is a numbering
  erratum: the register's `-8` is the placement item and `-9` is the
  direction addend. `OL-T11-10` (FU-89 key-seeding consumers) closed with the
  FU-89 §11 errata.
- **Phase table (FU-143):** the 35 FU-83 phase rows (handlers `0x110794`,
  classes `0x1106AD`) and the transitions `FUN_000740A0` / `FUN_000888FC` /
  `FUN_0008A938` / `FUN_0008B9CC` are derived and ported at the loader level
  (`fifa96_action_phase_row/_act/_situation/_period_end`), with open legs
  `OL-72`…`OL-79`. The phase driver `fifa96_match_run_phase_drive` is **wired
  into the run loop** (M2 playability Task 3): each granted frame it applies
  the class-1/class-2 gate and consumes the FU-62 clock's `sec == limit + aux`
  completion (`mr.clock_period_ended`), running the derived `FUN_0008B9CC`
  chooser — a live class-1 period end writes phase 0x0C (2 → 0x0C) on the
  selector-0/no-extra-time default, and the run-end teardown resets to 0.
  `fifa96_match_run_begin` now installs the **derived kickoff phase entry**
  (M2 visible-match Task 2 / `OL-84`): the native phase-0x17 handler stage-0
  write `FUN_000740A0(1, side)` (`0x88E82`, after `FUN_00073E28` and before the
  `FUN_00073E08` placement commit the begin path models) lands as
  `FIFA96_MATCH_RUN_KICKOFF_PHASE = 1`, mirroring the `phase_machine` switch
  byte. Follow-up-4 Task 2 lands the **OL-84 residual**: begin also runs the
  derived `FUN_0008D098` state-1 arm
  (`fifa96_match_phase_machine_kickoff`: code-3 multi-install, the
  `FUN_00079CCC` nearest pick — formation-target substitution — the action 1/2
  taker installs and the team targets), the wired action row 01
  (`fifa96_match_action_01`) walks the native stage machine and its
  situation-0xB call runs `fifa96_match_run_situation` (`0x8AEF6` ->
  `0x8AF02` = phase 2), and `fifa96_match_run_frame` arms the derived act-1
  producer `mr.global_5882a` at `state.tick_total >= 0x78`. A begun run
  therefore reaches the live phase 2 naturally (pinned by
  `test_engine_match_frame::test_kickoff_enters_phase2_naturally`; FU-143
  §11). The remaining situation-0xB producers (rows 02/0x10..0x13, the
  keeper/restart bodies, the computed act-8 call) and row 01's
  camera/event/ball-stage sinks stay open legs (`OL-84` narrowed).
  The extra-time flag producer (`OL-85`, re-verified at `0x8B2AC`/`0x8B2C1`)
  and the post-period 0x0C hold/reset timing (`OL-86`) stay open, and the
  natural chain is not frame-for-frame identical to the forced window
  (FU-143 §11.5), so the M2-B
  tape keeps its declared phase forcing (0x13/0x14 kickoff, phase 2 mechanics)
  and stays byte-identical. See FU-143 §9/§10/§11 (integration errata).
- **Score event source (child `C3-OL2`, closed; invokers unreachable — M2
  playable-match Task 3 verdict).** The FU-72
  `FUN_00093944` writer is derived and ported
  (`fifa96_action_score_event`, FU-142 Appendix L): score increment, last-side
  and tracked-side goal-difference bookkeeping, and the
  `FUN_0009252C` threshold posts (0x9A..0xA0, 0xD3). It is wired as the live
  run's source (`fifa96_match_run_score_event`, with the writer's four state
  cells and `score_last_event`), and the M2 tape's goal step uses it
  (transcript byte-identical). **No writer invoker is reachable from the ported
  rows/state** (FU-142 App. L.9, first-hand): all eleven `FUN_00093944` sites
  lie in the six period-indexed handlers (`0x110F78`); the only situation-6
  producer is `0x88B44` in `FUN_00088940`, reached only through the camera-pan
  arming (`FUN_0007131C 0x713A6..0x713F7` sets `[0x15781D]`/`[0x15781E]`) and
  the clock scan call (`FUN_0008AF38 0x8B63E`) — the engine camera never
  leaves spawn; the goal queue (`0x8A9E8` ids 5/6), the scheduler
  (`FUN_000948AC 0x4B1A1`, `0x949E9 CALL [0x15B6D4]`) and the handler
  installer (`FUN_00092D8C` ← screen machine `FUN_00038630` case 0xF;
  `FUN_00092E2C 0x92EEE`) are unported. Act 8's computed `0x8A8CE` is resolved
  as the phase-0x1E handler re-dispatching the situation the dispatcher stored
  (`[0x15882B]`), not a goal path. The negative is pinned by
  `test_goal_situation_dispatch_is_not_the_writer`,
  `test_natural_phase2_never_scores`, row 01's score-freshness assertions and
  the tape's pre-score assertions. Open legs: **OL-87** (handlers + scheduler +
  installer), **OL-88** (camera-pan goal detection), **OL-89** (posted-id
  dispatch `FUN_0009252C` and the `FUN_000CBC4C` probe). The engine
  carries tracked side -1 (`add_goal`-equivalent) until OL-87 lands;
  `fifa96_match_run_add_goal` remains for those unported paths.
- Retail front-end art asset (no OPTIONS-like path exists in the ISO).
- Per-row cluster legs carried in FU-139/FU-141/FU-142 (`OL-56`…`OL-71`:
  unmodeled record bytes, process globals, camera/track inputs, roster
  descriptors, animation selectors).
